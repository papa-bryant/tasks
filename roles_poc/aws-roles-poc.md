# AWS SSO Roles with Managed Policies - Proof of Concept

## 1. Objective

Implement four distinct AWS IAM roles using AWS-managed policies where available:
- Superadmin: AWS-managed AdministratorAccess
- Admin: Custom policy (excluding IAM/sensitive services)
- Poweruser: AWS-managed PowerUserAccess
- Read-only: AWS-managed ReadOnlyAccess

## 2. Role Policies

### 2.1 Superadmin Role
Use AWS-managed policy: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess`

Key characteristics:
- Full unrestricted access to all AWS services
- Can manage IAM users/roles/policies
- Can access billing and organizations
- Automatically updated by AWS for new services

### 2.2 Admin Role
Custom policy required to exclude IAM/sensitive services:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "NotAction": [
        "iam:*",
        "organizations:*",
        "account:*",
        "billing:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2.3 Poweruser Role
Use AWS-managed policy: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess`

Key characteristics:
- Full access to all AWS services
- Cannot manage IAM users/groups
- Cannot modify roles/policies
- Cannot access billing
- Automatically updated by AWS for new services

### 2.4 Read-Only Role
Use AWS-managed policy: `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess`

Key characteristics:
- Read-only access to all AWS services
- Automatically updated by AWS for new services
- Includes Describe*, Get*, and List* actions

## 3. Role Comparison Matrix

| Capability                | AdministratorAccess | Admin | PowerUserAccess | ReadOnlyAccess |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Create IAM users/roles   | ✅                  | ❌    | ❌              | ❌             |
| Manage billing           | ✅                  | ❌    | ❌              | ❌             |
| Create resources         | ✅                  | ✅    | ✅              | ❌             |
| View resources           | ✅                  | ✅    | ✅              | ✅             |
| Access new services      | ✅                  | ✅    | ✅              | ✅             |
| Modify Organizations     | ✅                  | ❌    | ❌              | ❌             |

## 4. Benefits of AWS-Managed Policies

1. Automatic Updates:
   - AWS maintains and updates policies
   - New services automatically included
   - Security patches applied by AWS

2. Standardization:
   - Consistent permissions across organization
   - AWS best practices built-in
   - Reduced risk of misconfiguration

3. Simplified Management:
   - Only one custom policy needed (Admin)
   - Reduced administrative overhead
   - Easy to audit and track

## 5. Monitoring and Security

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail:
```bash
aws cloudtrail create-trail \
  --name management-events \
  --s3-bucket-name your-bucket \
  --is-multi-region-trail
```

2. Set up alerts for:
   - AdministratorAccess role usage
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Permission changes
   - Policy attachments/detachments

## 6. Best Practices

1. Regular Reviews:
   - Quarterly access reviews
   - User assignment validation
   - Usage pattern analysis

2. Emergency Access:
   - Break-glass procedures for AdministratorAccess
   - Emergency access audit trail
   - Regular testing of emergency procedures

3. Documentation:
   - Keep role assignments updated
   - Document approval workflows
   - Maintain change logs

## 7. Next Steps

1. Implementation:
   - Create SSO permission sets
   - Attach managed policies
   - Configure CloudTrail

2. Testing:
   - Validate all role permissions
   - Test emergency procedures
   - Verify monitoring

3. Documentation:
   - Update internal wikis
   - Create user guides
   - Document procedures

4. Training:
   - Train administrators
   - User awareness sessions
   - Document emergency procedures
